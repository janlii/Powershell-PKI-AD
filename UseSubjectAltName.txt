KDC support for Key Trust account mapping

Beginning with Windows Server 2016, domain controllers have support for Key Trust account mapping as well as fallback
to existing AltSecID and User Principal Name (UPN) in the SAN behavior.

When UseSubjectAltName is set to:
0: Explicit mapping is required. Then there must be either:
- Key Trust (new with Windows Server 2016)
- ExplicitAltSecID
1: Implicit mapping is allowed (default):
- If Key Trust is configured for account, then it is used for mapping (new with Windows Server 2016).
- If there is no UPN in the SAN, then AltSecID is attempted for mapping.
-	If there is a UPN in the SAN, then UPN is attempted for mapping
